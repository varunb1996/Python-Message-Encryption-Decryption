Encoding is the process of converting text into an incognizable language and the reverse process in decoding. In this project, we will be using the Tkinter module and base64 module to do the required operations.

In this,

The user first enters the message and key
And choose one of the encode or decode options
Based on the choice the corresponding operation is done
It is to be noted that the same key used for encryption needs to be used during the decryption.
